# Installing Homebrew on a Mac

Great! Now that you've opened the terminal on your Mac, we need to install Homebrew next. Homebrew is a package manager for the Mac, and installing it makes the whole Exercism installation process easier. If you want to Exercism manually, [[Manual Installation on a Mac]] would be helpful.

Since Homebrew is pretty common on Macs, let's first verify whether you have it on your computer.

---

## Tutorial

### Step 1

#### Exercise

To verify if homebrew is installed, type in the following text into your terminal:

```
brew
```

> Sidenote: This tutorial contains more of these. Whenever you see text surrounded by a box, it means that you need to type in or copy and paste the text in the box. We recommend the latter to avoid typos.


![Clicking the magnifying glass](https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohhwwLsE2xC7Ts796/giphy.gif)

After typing in the command, hit the `Enter` key.

#### Verify

After hitting the `Enter` key, your terminal should give you a reply.

##### Homebrew is not installed

When you see the following reply, it means that Homebrew isn't installed on your Mac yet.

[Homebrew not installed](https://i.imgur.com/uNdKrgQ.png)

> Sidenote: This reply means that the terminal doesn't understand the `brew` command. Your terminal may reply with a different text, but if it means that the `brew` command isn't understood, it still means that homebrew isn't installed.

##### Homebrew is installed

When you see the following reply, it means that Homebrew is installed.

[Homebrew installed](https://i.imgur.com/n5MK7uO.png)

> Sidenote: This reply means that the terminal understands the `brew` command. Your terminal replies with examples of how the `brew` command can be used. Again, the text can vary from terminal to terminal, but the underlying principle should be that the terminal understands the `brew` command.

### Wrapping up

If you've reached the end of this tutorial, you should be able to determine whether you've installed Homebrew or not.

---

## Do you have Homebrew installed?

- [[Yes->Installing Exercism via Homebrew]]
- [[No->Installing Homebrew]]

::Installing Homebrew
# Installing Homebrew

Now that we've found out that homebrew isn't installed on your computer yet, let's install it! If you'd like to read more on Homebrew before installing it, the [Homebrew webpage](https://brew.sh/) is a good resource.

---

## Tutorial

### Step 1

#### Exercise

Paste in the following text into your terminal:

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

After typing in the command, hit the `Enter` key.

#### Verify

After hitting the `Enter` key, you should see that the terminal prompts you to confirm installation.

[Confirming installation](https://i.imgur.com/crz6jJK.png)

### Step 2

#### Exercise

Hit the `Enter` key to confirm the `homebrew` installation.

#### Verify

After hitting the `Enter` key, the terminal prompts you to confirm again by typing in your password.

[Input password](https://i.imgur.com/eaVWPoZ.png)

### Step 3

#### Exercise

Type in your password in the terminal and hit `Enter`.

> Sidenote: If it's your first time doing this, you might be confused that as you are typing, nothing appears. This is a security feature of the terminal. Just keep on typing and press `Enter` when you finish.

#### Verify

##### Incorrect password was typed in

You will see a message that an incorrect password was typed in. First, try to verify if you've typed your password correctly. If it still doesn't work, it may be the case that the password you have isn't the administrator's password. It would be good to ask your administrator to put in the password for you.

##### Correct password was typed in

Your terminal should now reply saying that the `homebrew` installation has started. It may look something like this:

[Homebrew installing](https://i.imgur.com/fWfoj8c.png)

### Step 4

#### Exercise

Since `homebrew` is still installing at this point, the only need thing we need to do is wait. It may take at most 5 minutes.

#### Verify

##### Installation is successful

After waiting, your terminal must respond with a message saying that the Homebrew installation is complete. It may look something like this:

[Homebrew install confirmation](https://i.imgur.com/BIKJugP.png)

##### Installation isn't successful

If you don't seem to see a message confirming that homebrew is installed, we first recommend to check whether your internet connection is up. The installation process requires it. If your connection is up, we recommend running the install process again.

### Wrapping up

Once you've reached the end of this tutorial, you should've installed Homebrew on your computer.

##### Installation finished

The installation is finished once you see this message on your terminal:

[Pouring](https://i.imgur.com/bIAS3MY.png)

> Sidenote: The message on your terminal doesn't need to exactly match the screenshot. If you see the message "Pouring...", that should be enough.

##### Installation taking too long

If your installation is taking too long, we recommend checking your internet connection. If your internet connection is up, we recommend trying to run the command again. It might work this time!

### Step 2

#### Exercise

In order to verify whether exercism was successfully installed, paste the following text into your terminal.

```
exercism
```

After typing in the command, hit the `Enter` key.

#### Verify

##### Installation successful

After hitting the `Enter` key, the terminal should reply with how the `exercism` command can be used.

[Exercism usage](https://i.imgur.com/hy4QmaJ.png)

> Sidenote: As you get the hang of Exercism, you'll get to know more about the commands.

##### Installation unsuccessful

After hitting the `Enter` key, the terminal still doesn't recognize the `exercism` command.

[Exercism not installed](https://i.imgur.com/HWfY57R.png)

> Sidenote: The messages might vary per computer, but if the message you receive means that the terminal couldn't understand the `exercism` command, you have to try installing again.

If you've encountered this, we recommend trying to install again. It might work this time!
